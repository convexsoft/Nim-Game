## Description

A classical two-player Nim game that uses a single layer neural network 
model with crowdsourcing. This game requires two players to take 
alternating turns to choose a number of stones to remove from an initial 
pile, and the player who takes the last stone loses the game.

The figure illustrates the training process and the number of game trials needed for our Nim game AI
to learn a skillful strategy using a single-layer neural network and crowdsourcing.
